This is a working example for use with the Facebook application system which allows authentication.

To use: -

1. Put the HTML file on a public facing Web server with fixed DNS.
2. Make an application in Facebook. (See Facebook developer documentation)
3. In the Facebook application settings, input the URL of the HTML file.
4. Replace REPLACEWITHYOURFACEBOOKAPPNUMBER in the HTML with your Facebook application id. .
5. It would go to the URL, you should see a Facebook log in button (This may not work until Facebook authorise the Facebook application).
